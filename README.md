## 1. General Structure
### 1.1. Design Logic And Philosophy
Portfolio consists of seven different full width and height pages. Website welcomes user with loading page and preloads all the scripts, styles and other assets. When all loading finishes, it automatically scrolls to `intro` page and removes loading page.

#### Layout
I tried to keep the following structure on the pages:
- Left section: Design-related element with interactive features.
- Right section: Code and technical information.
- Header section: Navigation links
- Bottom section: Next buttons

You can find out the utilization of the idea on `Introduction`, `Skills` and `Works` pages.

#### Colors
Color Palette is chosen from three vivid and primary colors - `hsl(350, 100%, 62%)`, `hsl(164, 100%, 40%)` and `hsl(204, 100%, 52%)`.

For background, three shades of `hsl(249, 14%, 30%)` and `hsl(0, 0%, 90%)` used.

#### Typography

Typefaces chosen from [Proxima Nova](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova/) for headings and [Rooney Sans](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jan-fromm/rooney-sans/) for texts.

### 1.2. Development Strategy

Website built on PHP and plain CSS and Javascript.

It uses different plugins to benefit their own features. For example, jQuery for DOM manipulation, D3.js for SVG interactions, THREE.js for 3D rendering and animation, GSAP TweenMax for performant animations.

#### Mobile Detection
[Mobile Detect](https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect) library is a very simple plugin to detect device.

```php
<?php
$detect = new Mobile_Detect;
$isMobile = $detect->isMobile();
?>
```


It adds different array of scripts and section of the webpage according to device is mobile or not i.e.

```php
<?php if ($isMobile):?>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="app.mobile.js"></script>
<?php else:?>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="app.js"></script>
<?php endif ?>
```



### Build

Grunt is used to minify and optimize Javascript and CSS files.

It fetches all the files from `dirs.json` and `dirs.json` to concatenate and uglify.

```javascript
{
  dirs: grunt.file.readJSON('dirs.json')
}
```
I always work and debug with source files so I created a different build structure. There is a separate JSON file â€“  [dirs.json](dirs.json) which has the list of all files for desktop and mobile version. If I use `DEV` in `config.php`, files are served one by one. Otherwise, I use `DIST` property and it prints only minified JavaScript and CSS files. All the required script and styles are added in dirs.json.

![File Loader](ext/file-loader.png)


#### Preloader
It uses two different loader for preloading. [pxLoader](http://thinkpixellab.com/pxloader/) for images and [lazyload.js]() for scripts and css files. I allocated empirical percentage for image, script and style files and adjust the arc of the loading circle.

### 2.1. Design Logic And Philosophy
#### 2.1.1. Loading
Scene starts with two horizontal lazy lines moving symmetrically. An arc starts and complete a circle which represents how much of the content is loaded. Meanwhile, a goo animation of 6 small and one big circles are added to keep visitor's attention on scene. Loading animation was inspired by one of the old experiments done by [Sharp & Nimble](http://sharpandnimble.com/experiments)

After loader passes, user is welcomed with a fixed width introductory text introducing me and what I am doing.

#### 2.1.2. Introduction

The key idea to surprise the visitor at these scene. Left side represents design whereas right one represents code. User sees a **colorful tentacle animation** on the left and a **glitch animation** on the right section.

#### 2.1.3. Skills

Skills chart is what I experimented and satisfied with the result. Basically it's a radar chart, but in 3D!
